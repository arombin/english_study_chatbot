# Gemini Chatbot

## project intro

<br>

This chatbot is inspired by the Speak English conversation app, which offers a AI services.😄

The AI chatbot in Speak allows users to set the concept of the conversation and engage in role-play as if they were talking to a real person. Additionally, it corrects any mistakes or awkward phrasing in the user's dialogue. 

However, these features are 💸subscription-based💸, with real-time corrections available only to ⭐premium plus⭐ users. Therefore, in this project, we have utilized the Gemini Chatbot API to create functionality similar to that of Speak!
